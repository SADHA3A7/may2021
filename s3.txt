S3 : Simple Storage Service : 

Object Based Storage :  Designed to store flat files. (pdf/docx, .exe, .msi) : GDrive : S3 
Block Based Storage : Designed to run OS/ applications.. : EBS, Instance Store
Storage over the network : (SAN/NAS) : Storage device available over the network, network resources can connect it and access the data..  EFS, FSx

--> S3 is Object Based Storage. We cannot install any OS or we cannot run any application in this s3 platform.
--> We are going to store all data in S3 "BUCKETS".
--> Bucket name should be unique.
--> We have unlimited data in s3 platform.
--> Defaultly we can create 100 buckets in AWS account. (Soft limit : We can raise ticket to increse this count).
--> Bucket Naming Limitations : 
	--> Bucket name should contains only lowercase letter. No uppercase.
	--> SHould not start . / Endwith . / Adjesent ..
	--> SHould not resemble IP address format.

--> We can upload/download/share the bucket data.
--> Object : Data uploading to s3 bucket.
--> Maximum Object size S3 supports : 5 TiB, Min Obj Size : 0/1 Byte
--> S3 is a global service. Does not required any region selection.

Object url : https://s3.regioncode.amazonaws.com/bucketname/objectname

Virtual Path : It won't work when we have . in the bucket names..
https://bucketname.s3.regioncode.amazonaws.com/objectname
https://bucketname.s3.amazonaws.com/objectname

https://1avinash.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/s3.txt

--> If we want to make any data publicly accesable, We need to edit Bucket level "public Access settings". (Block all public access : On)

--> Make object public, then we can access the file.

Block Public Access settings for this account : Use Amazon S3 Block public access settings to control the settings that allow public access to your data.


S3 Standard : Default storage class for our data. Data will be available immediately. Designed to store Frequently accessed data.
Data replicates across >= 3 AZs
Availability : 99.99%
Durability : 99.999999999% (11 9's)

Standard-IA (Infrequently Accessed) : We can store infreq accessed data. Data will be available immediately.
Data replicates across >= 3 AZs
Availability : 99.9%
Durability : 99.999999999% (11 9's)

Onezone-IA : We can store infreq accessed data. Data will be available immediately.
Data stores only in 1 AZ only
Availability : 99.5%
Durability : 99.999999999% (11 9's)

S3 Glcier : We can archieve data for longer durations. We cannot access the data immedeatly. When we required, we need to initialise the data restoration.  Data restoration takes Min-Hrs.
Data replicates across >= 3 AZs
Availability : 99.99%
Durability : 99.999999999% (11 9's)

S3 Glacier Deep Archieve : We can archieve data for longer durations. We cannot access the data immedeatly. When we required, we need to initialise the data restoration.  Data restoration takes Hours.
Data replicates across >= 3 AZs
Availability : 99.99%
Durability : 99.999999999% (11 9's)

S3 Intelligent Tiering : When we have unknown access patterns. 
Data replicates across >= 3 AZs
Availability : 99.9%
Durability : 99.999999999% (11 9's)

RRS (Redused Redundancy Storage) : Not recommanded.. Less durability. Chances to loss the data is more compare to another storage classes. TO store easily repodusable data, Non Mission critical data.. 
Data replicates across >= 3 AZs
Availability : 99.9%
Durability : 99.99%

GLacier Retrivals : 
Bulk retrieval : Typically within 5-12 hours.
Standard retrieval : Typically within 3-5 hours.
Expedited retrieval : Typically within 1-5 minutes when retrieving less than 250 MB. 

Free Tier : 5 gb s3 standard storage.
2000 PUT (upload) Operations and 20,000 GET (open/download) operations. Value reset everymonth 1st. 

Data retrival cost involved for : standard-IA, onezone-IA, Glacier, G Deep archieve..

__
Versioning : 
--> We can track all changes happening on this file.
--> If we accidentally deleted the object, we can get it back if versioning is enabled.

Most recent uploaded object called as "Current Object / Latest object"

(version: hide)
When versioning is enabled, If we delete the object, we will get the "Delete Marker", Delete the Delete marker to get this object back to s3 bucket.

(version: show)
Whatever we deletes, we won;t get any delate marker. Object deletes permanently.


delete : Create a Delete Marker.
permanently delete : THis object deletes permanently, without delete marker.

LCR : LifeCycle Management Rule : 

expire : We will get a Delete marker.

CRR/SRR : 
--> Source bucket and Destination bucket should enabled with Versioning.
--> If source bucket and destination bucket is in same region : SRR (Same region replicaiton)
--> If source and destination buckets are in diff region : CRR (Cross region replication).

RTC : Replication Time Control : Boost up the replication process. Max of data replicates within 15 min. 

--> Existing objects won't replicate to destination bucket. ALl future/subsequent uploads will replicate to destination bucket.
