EC2 : Elastic Compute Cloud

Full Front : 
Server --> Server rack --> netwrk devices --> Network rack --> Power connectivity  --> Cooling systems --> Physical security --> FIrewall 
--> O/S --> Install application --> Deliver

ec2 : Get a server based on your current requirement.. 

______

On-Demand ec2 instance : When we have Unpredictable workloads, Testing for the first time.. 
Pricing : /Sec (Min of 60 Sec) / /hr

Reserved ec2 Instances : When our workload is stable and predictable.. For longer durations.. We need to reserve the capacity for 1 Yr/3 yrs.

	Standard RI : We cannot change the configuration during the period.
	COnvertable RI : We can change the configuration.
	Scheduled RI : If we have persistent / repeated requests. 
Pricing : 
	Full upfront : Pay 100% as onetime.
	Partial upfront : Pay 30-50% as onetime, THen remaining amount on monthly basis with redused hrly price.
	No Upfront : Pay everything monthly basis.

Spot ec2 instances : When we have flexible start/stop durations.. No critical data/application is delivering.. Test/UAT.. Bid your price against the aws pricing. 

--> If your quoted price is more than or equal to aws price, we will get an EC2 instance.
--> If price increased aws will Terminate our ec2 instance.

If price increased AWS termnated instance, we need to pay only completed billing hours.
If price not increased YOU termnated instance, we need to pay for full usage hours.

1 hr 30 Min : AWS terminated : 1 Hr
1 Hr 30 Min : YOU terminated : 1 Hr 30 Min

AWS Marketplace : place to purchase/sell our resources.

--> Ec2 is a region specific service.
	--> Mumbai
	--> N virginia

Step 1 : Choose an AMI (Amazon Machine Image)	: Operating System : Windows server 2016 base
	
Step 2 : Choose an Instance type 		: vCPU, Memory(RAM), Network perf
__


General Purpose : Stable/balanced performance of compute, memory and network resources.
Type : t2, t3, m5

Compute Optimized : We will get more CPU performances from these instances. We will have high perf processors in these instances.
Type : c4, c5, c6  (Compute / CPU)

Memory Optimized : We will get more RAM perf. Workloads required to process large set of data via memory.
Type : r4, r5, r6, x1, z1 (RAM)

GPU Optimized / Accelerated computing : We will get more graphic processings, Efficient for data pattern matching, High level gaming.
Type : p2, p3, p4, g3, g4, f1

Storage optimized : we will get more Storage/ Hard Disk performance. FOr the application required more IOPS, we use this types.
Type : d2, d3, i3

m5.large	: 2 CPU, 8 RAM
c5.xlarge	: 4 cpu, 8 ram
t3.medium	: 2 cpu, 4 ram

Maintenance windows : Sat 06 AM IST.. 

Step 3 : Configure additional settings
	VPC, ROles, userdata

	Instance Termination protection : Enable
	SHoutdown behaviour : STOP

Step 4 : Choose storage

	root volume : volume that contains Operating system : 30 gb for windows

Step 5 : Add Tags : COmbination of Key and Value pairs.

Name : 
Project : 
Platform : Windows / Linux
COst center : AAZAA

Step 6: Configure Security Group : Security group acts as Firewall at Instance level.

OS Ports/protocols : 0 - 65535

Windows : RDP : 3389 : 
Linux : SSH : 22
Webserver : http : 80
Secure web : https : 443

source : From where you want to connect to this instance.
MyIP : 
Custom : 
Anywhere : 

Step 7 : Review and launch with keypair.

Keypair : Key pair contains public key and private key. (.pem)

AWS Holds the Public Key.
Customer/WE holdes the Private key.


COnnect to Windows Instance :

--> Open "run" , type "mstsc" , CLick enter.. Provide instance "Public IP".
--> Choose instance "connect', choose "RDP Client", "Download remote desktop file"

MAC : https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id1295203466?mt=12


start/stop : 10 days work.. 1 month.. : Stop, Start the server
Terminate : Delete the server..


Task : Launch windows ec2 instance and using keypair get connect to ec2 instance.

Task 2 : CHange the password of "Administrator", Disconnect from the instance. Now try to login to ec2 instance using "keypair pwd" , "Custom password".

Task 3 : Create a user in ec2 instance provide him "Local administrator rights", also provide him "Remote desktop permissions".. Take a session with this user along with administrator.

Elastic Block Storage : EBS volumes
IOPS : Input and output operations per second

root volume : COntains Operating System : gp2, gp3, io1, io2 & standard
Additional VOlume : st1 & sc1.. along with all other types

General Purpose SSD : (gp2 / gp3) : Low latency interactive applications, Dev and test environment..!!
Min : 1 GiB, Max: 16 TiB... Max IOPS: 16,000 IOPS
gp2 --> works 1 : 3 ration (1 gb volume = 3 iops), with min of 100..
for gp3, we have an advantage, we can mention/choose required IOPS count.
__

Provisioned iops : (io1 & io2) : workload that requires Specific IOPS count.. or if we need more than 16,000 iops for our ec2 instance.. I/O Intensive database workloads..
Min : 4 GiB, Max: 16 TiB... Max IOPS: 64,000 IOPS
--> It provided highest performance among all. 
__

Magnetic : Standard : Less freq accessed data, Low cost storage solutions.. 
Min : 1 GiB, Max: 1 TiB...
__

Throughput optimized HDD : st1 : Bigdata, Data warehousing, log processing.. 
Size : Min 125 GiB - 16 TiB.. IOPS : 500.. Throughput : 500 MB/S..

Cold HDD : sc1 : THroughput orientes storages, but with Less Frequently accessed.. Lower cost than st1.. 
Size : Min 125 GiB - 16 TiB.. IOPS : 250.. Throughput : 250 MB/S..

_____________________

Free Tier : 30 Gib /Month.. General purpose (gp2 only) and Magnetic Storage.. 

__

--> EC2 instance and EBS volumes should be in same region, THen only we can associate it to ec2 instance. 

We need to make newly added volume available at OS level.

run --> diskmgmt.msc --> Make "online", "Initialise disk", Write File System.

Windows : FAT, FAT 32, NTFS, ReFS
Linux : ext3, ext4, xfs
__

Increase the size of an Existing volume..??
--> First increase size in AWS Console, Then Increase at OS level.

__

VOlume 1 is with Instance 1.. Same volume required for Instance 2..!!! 
--> Yes, It's possible.. But Both the Instances should be in Same AZ.

__

1a-instance and 1b-instance.. 1a instance volume need to detach and it should attach to 1b-instance.. (Our instances are running in different AZs)..!!

Choose the Volume --> Create a Backup (snapshot) --> Create a volume in desired AZ.

Snapshot : Backup copy of our EBS volume.

__

Instance-1 is in Mumbai Region.. Instance-2 is in Another Region..!!!

Choose the Volume --> Create a Backup (snapshot) --> COpy the snapshot to desired region --> Create a volume from copied snapshot in desired Regions AZ.

__

Instance-1 is in Account-1... Instance-2 is in Account-2...!!!! 

Choose the Volume --> Create a Backup (snapshot) --> Choose "Modify permissions" option, Provide the 12 digit aws account id-2 then Save --> Find the snapshot in account-2 region --> Create a volume in desired Regions AZ.

____

You have a volume, that volume you want to share with everyone who have an aws account..!!

Choose the Volume --> Create a Backup (snapshot) --> Choose "Modify permissions" option, select "Public" --> Save

________________

Can we decrease the size of an EBS volume..??
Ans : NO.. Only increase is possible.


Task 1 : Launch an ec2 instance in ap-south-1a.. Create a "New volume with 1 gb size" in ap-south-1a and attach this volume to ec2 instance. Goto AWS console "Increase the volume size to 2 GB", make this 2gb volume available at OS level.

Task 2 : Launch an ec2 instance in ap-south-1a... Another ec2 instance in ap-south-1b..
Create a volume in ap-south-1a.. Attach it to "1a instance" and make it available.. Write some data into it..
Make Same volume available to "1b instance"..!!

DLM : Data lifecycle manager. 

Snapshots are point-in-time copies.
AWS uses s3 platform to store the snapshots (not your s3).

--> VOlume 
--> Instance

--> We need to have valid tags for the resources (volume/instance).


GoldenAMI / GOlden Image:  

Req: Create 10 ec2 instance, Custom WP, IIS, Custom user, custom password for administrator.. ms office, av, internal applications.. Comply with CIS..

ec2 instance --> Perform all customizations --> Create an Image.

IIS -> place your webpages :  C:\inetpub\wwwroot



Task : Create GoldenAMI with  Custom WP, IIS, Custom user, custom password for administrator..  
--> Launch an instance from GAMI, we should get all custom settings.
