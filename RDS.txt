RDS : Relational Database Service : 6 Relational db engines.
--> Amazon Aurora	(Mysql COmpatable / postgresql Compatable)
--> MySQL
--> MS SQL
--> PostgreSQL
--> MariaDB
--> Oracle

NoSQL database : IN AWS DynamoDB is a Serverless architecture.
--> DynamoDB : 

Caching solution for DynamiDB : DAX (Database Accelerator)
Caching for RDS : Elasticache (2 Open SOurce caching engines)
	--> MemcacheD
	--> Redis

DMS : Database Migration Service

Homogenious Migration : OnPrem MYSQL --> DMS Cluster --> AWS RDS MYSQL
Heterogenious migration : OnPrem DB2 --> SCT --> DMS Cluster --> AWS RDS MYSQL

______

ec2 instance --> OS Level --> Install anything --> We have to take care below things.
Licensing..??
UPgradations..?? 
Backup..??
HA/FT..??

RDS --> Everything managed by AWS.

--> We won't get any choice to login to OS level.

GUI tools to manage the Databases : 
--> Amazon Aurora : Mysql Workbench / pgadmin
--> MySQL	: Mysql Workbench
--> MS SQL	: ssms (Microsoft Sql Server Management Studio)
--> PostgreSQL	: pgadmin
--> MariaDB	: workbench
--> Oracle	: oracle tool, Toad


Enable Public Access : Yes .. DB can be accesable over the internet, We can install tools in local device and connect. 
NO : The DB instance will be available to the resources running in same VPC.


--> DB ENgine 
--> Define Username and password (admin & custom/autogenerated)
--> Storage option
--> VPC
--> MultiAZ deployment
--> 

Version : -2 / -1 mechanism.. We don't go with latest version. 
Free Tier : Choose this
Credentials : Define Username and password (admin & custom/autogenerated)
DB Instance class : db.t2.micro
Storage : Min 20gb, Max: 16TB	: 20 GB

Storage Autoscaling : AWS will add storage automatically when the existing size is 80%.
	--> 10% of existing storage
	--> 5 GB .. WHich ever is higher, AWS choose it.

COnnectivity : 
VPC : CustomVPC
Public Access : NO
Port : 3306

Automatic Backup : AWS creates backups automatically. 
0 --> disable
1 --> Min 
35 --> Max

--> We will get DB Endpoint to connect to db instance. 


Task : Launch an Mysql RDS db instance in CUstomVPCs Private SUbnet. Launch an ec2 instance in CUstomVPCs public SUbnet and connect to instance and install Mysql workbench.

Multi-AZ deployment : 
Create a standby instance (recommended for production usage)
Creates a standby in a different Availability Zone (AZ) to provide data redundancy, eliminate I/O freezes, and minimize latency spikes during system backups.

--> We can reboot with failover.

_____________________________

Read Replica : Read Only copy of primary database. SUpports read ony operations.
--> We can promote the Read replica as individual database.

_____________________________________________________________________________________

D: 22/06/2021

SYstem Snapshot / Automated Snapshots : We cannot delete. Redise the backup retention period if required.
--> Deletes along with DB / We can keep these copies for the retention period after db deletation also.

Manaul Snapshot : We need to create these manually.
--> We need to delete these copis manually.

We can restore database from System / manual SS. 
--> Not an Inplace restoration. 
--> We can copy snapshot to another region. We can share with another AWS account.

--> Point-in-time-recovery : AWS Creates the recovery points on databse. 

Restore From s3 : We can take backup using 3rd party applicaitons (ex: percona Xtra backup), upload the backup copy to s3, then use the "restore from s3".
